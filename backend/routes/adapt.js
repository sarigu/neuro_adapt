  Break content into short, digestible paragraphs (2â€“3 sentences each). 
  - Bold the first letter of every sentence. Do NOT bold other letters in the sentence. 
  - Highlight key words and phrases in bold.
  - Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate.
  - Include clear headings to structure the content.
  - Example:
  Original: "Neanderthals lived in Europe. They were strong."
  Correct Adaptation:
  "**N**eanderthals lived in Europe. **T**hey were strong."
  Incorrect Adaptation:
  "**N**eanderthals lived in Europe. **T**hey were **s**trong."  // Do not bold internal letters

  Autism: `
  Present information in a clear, literal, and structured way. 
  - Avoid metaphors, idioms, or abstract language.
  - Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists.
  - Maintain consistent formatting and predictable patterns.
  - Example:
  Original: "Neanderthals adapted cleverly."
  Adapted:
  "## Neanderthal Adaptations
  - Neanderthals adapted to cold climates.
  - They used tools for hunting and gathering."

  Dyslexia: `
  Use short sentences and simple, familiar vocabulary. 
  - Break content into bullet points and small sections.

  Adapted:
  "- Neanderthals lived in Europe.
  - They also lived in western Asia.
  - Their timeframe: 400,000 to 40,000 years ago."
`,

  Dyspraxia: `
  Provide step-by-step instructions in a logical sequence.
  - Use clear headings, numbered lists, and bullet points.
  - Avoid cluttered layouts and overlapping visuals.
  - Example:
  Original: "Hunting required preparation and cooperation."
  Adapted:
  "## Hunting Steps
  1. Identify prey location.
  2. Prepare tools.
  3. Hunt with group cooperation."

  Dyscalculia: `
  Minimize heavy use of numbers or calculations in text.
  - Explain concepts in plain language.
  - Use real-world examples or visual comparisons.
  - Highlight important numbers or patterns with bold if needed.
  - Break numeric content into simple, manageable steps.
  - Example:
  Original: "Neanderthals existed from 400,000 to 40,000 years ago."
  Adapted:
  "- Neanderthals existed for hundreds of thousands of years.
  - They lived in Europe and western Asia during this time."
