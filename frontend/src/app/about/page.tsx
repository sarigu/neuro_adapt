          Helping every <br/> brain thrive
        </h1>
        <p>
          At <strong>NeuroAdapt</strong>, we believe that learning should work with your brain — not against it.
          Whether you’re neurodivergent or just looking for a better way to study, we’re here to support your unique way of thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re building tools that let students upload study material and choose how they'd like it adapted — from focus-friendly formats to more visual or simplified versions.
          With the help of smart technology and real student feedback, we aim to make studying feel less overwhelming and a lot more empowering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because everyone deserves to feel seen, understood, and supported in how they learn.
